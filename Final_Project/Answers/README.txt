######################################

For this folder, Final_Project, the files inside of Final_Project/Answers/ follows a bit of a different format. You will not find a teacher copy of the student notebooks. This is because nothing inside of the notebook was graded. Instead you will find the students' submitted final projects and presentations as well as the grade that were given. There are also some additional safety copies of notebooks that I used to create datasets given to the students. This may, or may not, be useful.

The students were given instructions about the final project both through the notebook on WetAI and through a google doc. A PDF of the google doc, Final_Project_Assignment.pdf, is provided here. The url for the google doc is:

The Code inside of the main folder Final_Project/ currently only works for the dataset from group 3. If you attempt to select another dataset from the dropdown it will cause an error. I deleted the other datasets because they take up a lot of space. if you are reusing this, you should upload your own datasets.
