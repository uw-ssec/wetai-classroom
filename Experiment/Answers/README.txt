The notebooks provided here are for "display only" I do not reccomend you actually try runningthe code in the notebook cells. This will produce an error, because I deleted the data in the folder data/ephys/ . I did this because the datasets are large and cumbersome. If you want to try running the code, I reccomend copying the notebook you want into the primary folder for Experiment/ and then running the notebook there.
